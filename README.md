SecondBrains is an open-source framework designed to empower SMEs and Startups with advanced workflow automation, data analytics, and AI agent building capabilities, using a selection of low-code or no-code tools. This framework developed with a focus on businesses without in-house technical teams, hence these tools have been chosen to minimize the need for a large team of developers, suitable for small project's budget.
